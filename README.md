# Project Name

Supervised Clustering with PELORA

## Overview

This project focuses on supervised clustering using PELORA, an algorithmic approach that combines elements of both supervised learning and clustering. The main goal is to perform clustering while leveraging the knowledge provided by labeled data.

The project consists of three main components:

1. `main.py`: This file serves as the main application, containing the implementation of supervised clustering algorithms. It provides a showcases the capabilities of PELORA.

2. `pelora.py`: This file contains the necessary functions and utilities for implementing the PELORA algorithm. Each function in this file describes a step in the PELORA algorithm, providing the necessary logic and computations.

3. `pelora.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook serves as a testing ground for the PELORA algorithm. It includes code snippets and examples to demonstrate the different steps of the algorithm, making it easy to understand and experiment with.

## Usage

To use the supervised clustering with PELORA:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Run `main.py` to launch the main application. Follow the code and provide the necessary inputs, such as the dataset, labels, and desired clustering parameters.

3. Explore the `pelora.py` file to understand the inner workings of the PELORA algorithm. Each function provides detailed explanations of the corresponding step in the algorithm.

4. Experiment with the `pelora.ipynb` notebook by executing code cells and modifying parameters. This notebook serves as a practical guide to test and understand the various steps of the PELORA algorithm.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies. Install them using `pip` or any other package manager:

- numpy
